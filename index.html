          Stranger Things is a science fiction-horror streaming television
          series created by the Duffer brothers. Set in the fictional town of
          Hawkins, Indiana in the 1980s, the show follows a group of friends who
          uncover supernatural mysteries involving secret government experiments
          and parallel dimensions. The main characters, including Eleven, a
          young girl with psychokinetic abilities, and the Demogorgon, a monster
          from the Upside Down, have become iconic in popular culture. The show
          has received critical acclaim for its storytelling, characters, and
          80s nostalgia, and has become one of Netflix's most successful
          original series, with four seasons currently released.
